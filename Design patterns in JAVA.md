# Design patterns in JAVA

A design pattern is a proved solution for any problem.

There are specifications and a set of rules in every pattern for solving problems. Design patterns are categorised based on these specifications.



#### Advantages of Design patterns:

- we can use design patterns in multiple projects
- Helps to define system architecture of the project
- Provide transparency to the design of an application.
- Created by software professionals and experts so its proved and tested solution.
- It provides clarity for building a better system and system architecture.
- It also provides prior hands-on experience.



#### Limitations of Design patter:

We can't have a design pattern for every problem we face in software development. So whenever we find a problem without any design pattern, after solving the problem we should make proper documentation.



In Software Development Life Cycle design pattern must use in the initial stage like Analysis and requirement phase. Using design pattern in this phase makes the job easy.
